                <p>With listentogether, two Spotify users can connect their accounts and get a playlist out of the tracks both accounts have saved.</p>
                <p>This project was inspired by my love of roadtrips. Have you ever gone on a roadtrip with other people and not known what music to 
                play? Sure, introducing each other to new music is always fun, but sometimes you just want to make sure that the music playing is 
                something that everyone can enjoy.</p>
                <p>On the front-end, listentogether was created purely with HTML and CSS. The back-end, which is all handled by the browser, is 
                vanilla JavaScript that obviously makes heavy use of the Spotify API to connect user accounts, retrieve their libraries, and save the
                playlists directly onto their profiles.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Account connection</h3>
                    <p>Users can connect their Spotify accounts to the application by clicking on the squares. This will bring them to a login page
                       with Spotify. This login page will also specify the specific permissions listentogether will need to be granted, specifically
                       viewing account data, viewing libraries, and creating playlists.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Playlist creation</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Once both accounts are connected, all the users need to do to create the playlist is click on the 'Create Playlist' button
                        between the two accounts.</p>
                        <p>Behind the scenes, the application will go through the libraries of both accounts and create a playlist out of the songs
                        that can be found in both.</p>
                        <p>Once this is done, the playlist will be displayed underneath the accounts.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Saving the playlist</h3>
                    <p>At this point, the created playlist just exists on listentogether. To save the playlist on the Spotify accounts, users
                       just need to give the playlist a name and click the 'Save' button.</p>
