                <p>I've been a fan of basketball and the NBA for close to ten years at this point, but admittedly—with 
                   school and working on programming projects—I haven't had as much time to watch the games recently. So,
                   with full understanding of the irony of the situation, I decided to take on another programming project
                   to help me keep up to date with the league.</p>
                <p>NBA Webscraper is a Python script that takes a calendar date from user input and presents the scores and 
                    statistical leaders of the five major categories (points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals) for all
                    the NBA games played on that day. It does so by using a Python library called BeautifulSoup to scrape and 
                    parse the HTML content of basketball-reference.com.</p>
                <p>Once the new NBA season starts in October, I intend to automate this program so that it emails me the scores
                   of the preceding night's games every morning, as well as video highlights and major news items.
