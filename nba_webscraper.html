                <p>I've been a fan of basketball and the NBA for close to ten years at this point, but admittedly—with 
                   school and working on programming projects—I haven't had as much time to watch the games recently. So,
                   with full understanding of the irony of the situation, I decided to take on another programming project
                   to help me keep up to date with the league.</p>
                <p>NBA Webscraper is an automated Python script that emails me a report of the ongoings of the NBA including a summary
                   of previous day's games and a collection of the top posts on the r/NBA subreddit. This is achieved using a Python 
                   library called BeautifulSoup to scrape and parse the HTML content of basketball-reference.com and reddit.com.</p>
                <p>The script is automated using crontabs, a UNIX-based job scheduler. Every morning at 6am, crontabs will run this
                   script, so that the report will be in my email inbox by the time I wake up.</p>
