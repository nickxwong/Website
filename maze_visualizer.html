                <p>Maze Visualizer is a Java application I created that is both an algorithm visualizer and a game.
                   Lately, I've been very interested in the concept of mazes, particularly "perfect" mazes, which
                   connect any two points by a unique path. In short, this was an opportunity for me to explore
                   both maze generation and pathfinding algorithms, as well as make a game out of them.</p>
                <p>First, users generate a maze by selecting from the collection of maze generation algorithms.
                   While each algorithm creates a perfect maze, they do so in different, visually-apparent ways.
                   Once the maze is generated, users use their arrow keys to try and get from the top-left corner
                   of the maze to the bottom-right corner before the application can do the opposite (on a separate
                   thread, the application will run a pathfinding algorithm to solve the maze itself).</p>

                        <div class="intro">
                            <p>Three different algorithms are used to generate mazes: Recursive Backtracking, Eller's Algorithm
                            and Prim's Algorithm. Each take a grid of squares and converts them into perfect mazes in
                            their own way.</p>
                            <p class="bold">Note: The following visualizations of each algorithm were simulated for the purposes of this
                            project walkthrough. In the actual application, mazes are generated at a much faster pace in
                            order to not give away the solution of the maze to the user. Furthemore, the mazes in the
                            application are generated from a 20x20 grid of squares, rather than the 5x5 grids shown here.</p>

                                    <p>The Recursive Backtracking algorithm starts at a single point (in this case, the top-left corner of the grid)
                                       and visits a randomly-selected, unvisited neighbor. Once the algorithm moves onto this new cell, the
                                       previously-visited cell is pushed onto a stack. When the algorithm visits a cell that has no more unvisited
                                       neighbors, the algorithm backtracks by visited the previous cell (the one on top of the stack). Eventually,
                                       the algorithm will backtrack all the way to the starting cell, terminating the algorithm and completing the
                                       maze.</p>
                                    <p>Once a cell has been visited, it will never be visited again by the algorithm. This prevents any cycles within
                                       the maze, which would go against the definition of a perfect maze. In comparison to the other algorithms, 
                                       the mazes generated by the Recursive Backtracking algorithm tend to feature long, sweeping corridors.

                                    <p>Unlike the Recursive Backtracking algorithmâ€”which starts at a single point, Eller's Algorithm generates the
                                       maze row-by-row. It places each cell into a set, which it shares with any other cell that it connects to. In
                                       the first pass-through of each row, cells are placed into their own unique sets or join the set of a neighbor.
                                       This is what dictates whether there's a horizontal passageway or a wall. On the second pass-through, vertical
                                       connections are randomly made with the next row down. Each set must have at least one vertical connection.</p>
                                    <p>As the algorithm runs, the number of sets steadily reduce. Once the maze is completely generated, only one set
                                       will remain. Since each set consists of all the cells that are connected to each other, this guarantees that
                                       there exists a single unique path between all the cells.</p>

                                    <p>With Prim's Algorithm, there are three types of cells. Visited cells (cells that are already part of the maze),
                                       border cells (cells that are direct neighbors to any of the visited cells), and unvisited cells (any other cells).
                                       In the visualization above, the border cells have a red background.</p>
                                    <p>Prim's Algorithm works by first selecting a random cell from the grid and adding any unvisited neighbors into a
                                       set of border cells. The next visited cell is selected randomly from this set of border cells (it can be any cell
                                       from the set, not just one that was a direct neighbor to the previously-visited cell) and the wall between it and
                                       an already-visited cell are removed. If a cell is selected that shares walls with multiple visited cells, only one
                                       is selected (at random) to be removed. The random nature of cell selection gives the illusion that the maze is growing 
                                       from different spots within the grid. The algorithm is complete when there are no more cells to select from the set
                                       of border cells.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Once the maze has been generated and the user has started solving the maze, the application will run a pathfinding algorithm
                           to attempt the maze, as well. The algorithm, in question, is Djikstra's Algorithm.</p>
                        <div class="example-image">
                            <img src="./img/projects/Maze-Visualizer/Djikstra/01.svg" style="width: 50%">

                        <p>The first step of the algorithm is to calculate the distances of each cell from the endpoint. If the endpoint has a distance
                           of zero, its direct neighbors have a distance of one. The algorithm will start at the endpoint (the bottom-right corner) and
                           recursively make its way through every cell in the grid until it reaches the starting point (the top-left corner).</p>
                        <p>In most cases, the algorithm will reach the starting point before it has visited all the cells. This is where the fact that 
                           we're working with perfect mazes differs from the normal implementation of Djikstra's Algorithm. Since we know that a perfect 
                           maze connects each cell through a single, unique path, we know that once we find the path we're looking for, we can move onto
                           the next step of the algorithm. Any more unvisited cells are guaranteed not to lead to the starting point.</p>

                        <p>Once the distances are calculated, the path from the starting point to the end point can easily be calculated. Starting at
                           the top-left corner, the distances of each direct neighbor are considered. Since the distances of each cell are based on
                           their distance from the endpoint, the algorithm simply picks the neighbor with lesser distance to visit next. Eventually,
                           the algorithm will make its way back to the endpoint, revealing the solution to the maze.</p>
                        <div class="example-image">

                        <p>In the application, the first step of the algorithmâ€”where the distances are calculatedâ€”is slowed down and visualized in
                           order to give the user a fair competition. As seen in the demonstration below, user movement is represented in the green
                           and the cells that the pathfinding algorithm has visited are represented in the purple. Cells that both the user and the
                           algorithm have both visited are represented in yellow. More often than not, this yellow path represents the solution. We
                           see that once either the user or the application has completed the maze, a darker yellow path is formed to represent the
                           solution.
