            <p>With listentogether, two Spotify users can connect their accounts and get a playlist out of the tracks both accounts have saved.</p>
            <p>This project was inspired by my love of roadtrips. Have you ever gone on a roadtrip with other people and not known what music to 
            play? Sure, introducing each other to new music is always fun, but sometimes you just want to make sure that the music playing is 
            something that everyone can enjoy.</p>
            <p>On the front-end, listentogether was created purely with HTML and CSS. The back-end, which is all handled by the browser, is 
            vanilla JavaScript that obviously makes heavy use of the Spotify API to connect user accounts, retrieve their libraries and save the
            playlists directly onto their profiles.</p>
